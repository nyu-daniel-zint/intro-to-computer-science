This repository and all its content is based on Amos Bloomberg's [Intro To Computer Science](https://github.com/nyu-java-programming/course-materials).

# Introduction to Computer Science

Slide presentations used to teach basic computer science concepts, largely focused on object-oriented programming.

## Deployed site

View the [schedule](https://nyu-daniel-zint.github.io/intro-to-computer-science/) and [syllabus](https://nyu-daniel-zint.github.io/intro-to-computer-science/syllabus/), which contain links to all deployed course materials.

## Running locally

The code in this repository is used to generate the course website using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and continuously deploy it using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

It is possible to run the website locally on your own machine.

- Assuming [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) is installed...
- Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) globally
- Install the dependencies listed in the `Gemfile` by running the command, `bundle`.
- run `bundle exec jekyll serve` or simply `jekyll serve` if that doesn't work.
